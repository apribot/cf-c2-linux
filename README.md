assorted tweaks to get it to run correctly

bios password for "optional kit configuration" is "toughkit"

keyfix.sh
  doesn't apply to most people, mine had the down and right arrow keys broken, so I remapped some adjacent keys. 
  the script enables auto-repeat for a former 'ctrl' key.
  
redirect-brightness.sh
  gets the volume buttons below the screen to function
  
rotatefix.sh
  allows the screen to use the gyro to automatically rotate, updates the touchpad for each orientation. useful in tablet mode.
